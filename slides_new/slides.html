# Introduction

## Reproducibility: What, Why, How

---

## Reproducibility: What

-   The concept of **reproducibility** is actually not clearly defined [Gun21; Pen11; 19; TK99; 99; SK21; ZM20]

  -   [Pen11]:
  &gt; A published data analysis is reproducible if the analytic data sets and the computer code used to create the data analysis are made available to others for independent study and analysis
  
  -   Artifact Review and Badging of Association for Computing Machinery  [99]: 
  &gt; "**Reproducibility** - The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials."
  
---

## Reproducibility: What

-   The concept of **reproducibility** is actually not clearly defined [Gun21; Pen11; 19; TK99; 99; SK21; ZM20]

  -   The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [19]: 
  &gt; "**Reproducibility** means computational reproducibility - obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. "

-   Reproducibility

  -   Artifacts provided by the authors of the original results
  
  -   A different team
  
  -   Obtain consistent (strong/weak) results
  
---

## Reproducibility: Why

-   Reproducibility is important to the community

  -   "Replication is the ultimate standard by which scientific claims are judged." But full replication can be very challenging. So reproducibility becomes "an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific claims" [Pen11]
  
  -   "an experimental result is not fully established unless it can be independently reproduced." [99]
  
  -   "a strong connection between openness and transparency and more reliable and trusted science" [19]
  
  -   "validate experimental results, promote integrity of research, and accelerate follow up work" [ZM20]

-   Reproducible research is important to those who do it [AR21]

  -   A by-product of careful attention to detail throught the research process
  
  -   Allows researchers to ensure that they can repeat the same analysis multiple times with the same results, at any point in that process


---

## Reproducibility: How

-   Efforts from researchers

  -   [19]: "To help ensure the reproducibility of computational results, researchers should convey clear, specific, and complete information about data, code, models, and computational methods and analysis that support their published results."
  
  -   "A three-step framework for conducting reproducible research" [AR21]
    
      +   Before data analysis: data storage and organization
    
      +   During analysis: best coding practices
    
      +   After data analysis: finalizing results and sharing
  
  -   Using tools that facilitate reproducible research [Las20; SKC00]
    
      +   "executable paper"
  
  -   [Reproducibility checklist](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-23/reproducibility-checklist/) (by Association for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and other organizations)


---

## Reproducibility: How

-   Efforts from funding agencies and organizations

  -   "consider investing in research and development of opensource, usable tools and infrastructure that support reproducibility for a broad range of studies across different domains in a seamless fashion" [19]
  
-   Efforts from journals and conferences

  -   "Journals should consider ways to ensure computational reproducibility for publications that make claims based on computations, to the extent ethically and legally possible." [19]

---

## Reproducibility: Challenges

-   The Reproducibility Crisis: researchers find difficulty in reproducing published results [SK21; RRR22; XC22; SD21]

-   Technological change / dependency hell [Zhe21; Boe15; Xie+14; AR21]
  
  -   Operational systems, hardware, and software are continuously changing
  
-   Complexity
  
  -   Knowledge about the field and the tools required to reproduce the results
  
-   Human error

-   Intellectual property rights

-   Challenges introduced by the review process

  -   Providing data, code, and instructions might break review anonymity [Baj+17]

## An Open-Source Implementation of the CMPS Algorithm for Assessing Similarity of Bullets

#### Ju &amp; Hofmann, "The R Journal: An Open-Source Implementation of the CMPS Algorithm for Assessing Similarity of Bullets", The R Journal, 2022

---

## Motivation

- An attempt to reproduce the work of [Che+19]

- The Congruent Matching Profile Segments (CMPS) algorithm developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for objective comparison of striated tool marks

- The description of the algorithm is provided in the paper

- Code and data are not available

---

## Background

**Firearm Examination - Comparison of bullets**

-   Land-engraved striation marks

-   Visual comparison: comparison microscope, professional skills

-   Bullet signatures
.img100[![](photos/barrel_bullet_ps.png)]

---

## Background

**Bullet signature**

-   Hare et al. (2017) [HHC17]

-   3D topographical images, x3p

-   Shiny app: `bulletInspectR`
.img75[![](img/figure1_v2.PNG)]

---

## Background

**Bullet signature**

-   crosscut, grooves, and profile of land engravings -- (a, b, c, d)

-   non-parametric LOESS smooth for the curvature to be removed [CGS91] -- (e)

-   bullet signature -- (f)
.img75[![](img/figure1_v2.PNG)]

---

## Background

**Examples of bullet signature**
-   two bullets fired from the same Ruger p-85 pistal barrel

-   known match comparison

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## CMPS algorithm

-   Congruent Matching Profile Segments (CMPS) algorithm [Che+19]

-   Objective comparison of striated tool marks (bullet signatures in our case)

-   CMPS score (a similarity score)

---

## CMPS algorithm

CMPS scores
-   bullet 1 - land 2 (1-2) vs bullet 2 - land 3 (2-3): 17
-   bullet 1 - land 2 (1-2) vs bullet 2 - land 4 (2-4): 1

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## CMPS algorithm

-   Comparison signature:
  -   Divided into consecutive and non-overlapping basis segments
-   Reference signature:
  -   Generate cross-correlation curves with basis segments

.img100[![](images/cmps_overview.jpg)]

.footer[plot cited from Chen et al. 2019]

---
 
## CMPS algorithm

-   Congruent registration position
  -   Based on cross-correlation values
  -   Identified as the "best" registration position by the majority of basis segments (position 0 in the plot)

.img100[![](images/cmps_overview.jpg)]

.footer[plot cited from Chen et al. 2019]


---
 
## CMPS algorithm
  
-   Congruent matching profile segments
  -   Basis segments taking the congruent registration position
  -   There are 5 congruent matching profile segments in this plot
  -   Final CMPS score: total number of congruent matching profile segments

.img100[![](images/cmps_overview.jpg)]

.footer[plot cited from Chen et al. 2019]

---
 
## CMPS algorithm

To make the CMPS algorithm more effective:

-   Multi-peak inspection:

  -   Each cross-correlation curve will contribute multiple peak positions

-   Multi-segment lengths strategy

  -   Both basis segments and their enlarged version will be used for calculating the cross-correlation curves

-   Different parameter settings in the algorithm


---
 
## Implementation

**cmpsR**

-   R package

```r
install.packages("cmpsR")
```

-   development version available on GitHub:  

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("willju-wangqian/CMPS")
```

- The website of the package: [https://willju-wangqian.github.io/CMPS/](https://willju-wangqian.github.io/CMPS/)

---
 
## Implementation

The main function:


```r
extract_feature_cmps(
  x,
  y,
  seg_length = 50,
  Tx = 25,
   npeaks_set = c(5, 3, 1),
  include = NULL,
  outlength = NULL
)
```

-   `x` and `y` are the comparison signature and reference signature, respectively

-   `seg_length` specifies the length of a basis segment

-   ` npeaks_set` controls whether or not to use multi-segment lengths strategy

---
 
## Implementation - Examples


```r
library(CMPS)
data(bullets)
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

-   Known match (KM) comparison: `1-2` vs `2-3`
-   Known non match (KNM) comparison: `1-2` vs `2-4`

---
 
## Implementation - Examples 

**Example 1**


```r
library(cmpsR)
data(bullets)

sig1 &lt;- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "1-2"][[1]]$sig
sig2 &lt;- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "2-3"][[1]]$sig
sig3 &lt;- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "2-4"][[1]]$sig

cmps.result.KM &lt;- extract_feature_cmps(sig1, sig2)
cmps.result.KNM &lt;- extract_feature_cmps(sig1, sig3)
```

-   Result of a known-match (KM) comparison:

```r
cmps.result.KM # 1-2 vs 2-3
#&gt; [1] 17
```

-   Result of a known-non-match (KNM) comparison:

```r
cmps.result.KNM # 1-2 vs 2-4
#&gt; [1] 1
```

---
 
## Implementation - Examples

**Example 2**


```r
cmps_without_multi_scale &lt;- 
  extract_feature_cmps(sig1, sig2, 
                       npeaks_set = 5, include = "full_result")

cmps_with_multi_scale &lt;- 
  extract_feature_cmps(sig1, sig2, 
                       npeaks_set = c(5,3,1), include = "full_result")
```

-   multi-peak inspection:

```r
cmps_without_multi_scale$CMPS_score
#&gt; [1] 20
```

-   multi-peak inspection with multi-segment lengths strategy:

```r
cmps_with_multi_scale$CMPS_score
#&gt; [1] 17
```


---
 
## Implementation

Full comparison of the two bullets in `CMPS::bullets`







&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

-   each bullet has 6 land engravings, providing 6 bullet signatures
-   36 pairwise land-by-land comparisons in total

---
 
## Metrics 

-   Chen et al. proposed two metrics for bullet-level comparison based on CMPS scores [Che+19]
  -   `\(\mathrm{CMPS_{max}}\)`, `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}}\)`

-   Another metric
  -   `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{diff}}\)`

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!--   --&gt;
&lt;!-- ## Metrics  --&gt;

&lt;!-- `\(\mathrm{CMPS_{max}}\)` --&gt;
&lt;!-- -   the highest CMPS score obtained among all pairwise bullet signature comparisons --&gt;

&lt;!-- In general, we assume each bullet has `\(n\)` land engravings (in our case `\(n=6\)`). Let `\(c_{ij}\)` denote the CMPS score of a comparison between bullet 1 land `\(i\)` and bullet 2 land `\(j\)`, for `\(i,j = 1, \dots, n\)`.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- `$$\mathrm{CMPS_{max}} = \max_{i,j} c_{ij}$$` --&gt;

---
 
## Metrics 

In general, we assume each bullet has `\(n\)` land engravings (in our case `\(n=6\)`). Let `\(c_{ij}\)` denote the CMPS score of a comparison between bullet 1 land `\(i\)` and bullet 2 land `\(j\)`, for `\(i,j = 1, \dots, n\)`. 



-   `\(\mathrm{CMPS_{max}}\)`: the highest CMPS score obtained among all pairwise bullet signature comparisons

-   `\(\mathrm{CMPS_{max}} = \max_{i,j} c_{ij}\)`

---

## Metrics

Let `\(P_k\)` denote bullet land pairs in phase `\(k\)` for `\(k = 0, \dots, n-1\)`, and `\(P_k = \{ (i,j): i = 1, \dots, n ; j = (i + k) - n \cdot \unicode{x1D7D9}_{i + k &gt; n} \}\)`, where `\(\unicode{x1D7D9}_A\)` denotes an indicator function. For example, `\(P_1 = \{ (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1) \}\)` when `\(n = 6\)`.



-   `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}}\)`: the highest possible mean CMPS score of signature comparisons that are in the same phase

-   `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}} = \max_{k} \left[  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{(i,j) \in P_k} c_{ij}\right]\)`

---
 
## Metrics 

Let `\(k^*\)` denote the phase that results in `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}}\)`

-   `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{diff}}\)`: the difference between `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}}\)` and the mean of all other CMPS scores

-   `\(\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{diff}} = \left[  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{(i,j) \in P_{k^*}} c_{ij}\right] - \left[  \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{(i,j) \notin P_{k^*}} c_{ij}\right]\)`


---
 
## Metrics

`$$\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{max}} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{(i,j) \in P_1} c_{ij} = 12.5$$`

`$$\mathrm{\overline{CMPS}_{diff}} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{(i,j) \in P_1} c_{ij} - \frac{1}{30} \sum_{(i,j) \notin P_1} c_{ij} = 10.97$$`
]
]  

- one score for bullet level similarity

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
 
## Results

Hamby set 252: 
-   parameter setting: multi-peak inspection with multi-segment lengths

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="\textwidth" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
 
## Evaluation

**Sum of squares ratio**

`$$V = \frac{\sum_k n_k (\bar{y}_{k.} - \bar{y}_{..})^2}{\sum_k \sum_l^{n_k} (y_{kl} - \bar{y}_{k.})^2 }$$`

-   `\(k=2\)`, `\(n_1 = 46\)`, `\(n_2 = 549\)`
-   `\(y_{kl}\)` - CMPS metric score
-   quantifies the separation between the KM group and the KNM group

---

## One Model that Fits Them All: Psychometrics with Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models

#### Submitted to Visualization and Data Analysis 2024

---

## Brief summary

-   [+22] provides a very good example of reproducible research

-   Both data and code are provided

-   [+22] built a two-stage model and concluded one of their variables of interest as insignificant

-   We proposed to use a generalized linear mixed effects model which has more statistical power and found the statistical significance of that variable

-   The re-analysis and new conclusion heavily relies on the efforts of [+22] for making their work reproducible

-   A shiny app named `Model Buildr` was developed to assist researchers in connecting the two-stage modeling approach with the GLME modeling approach
