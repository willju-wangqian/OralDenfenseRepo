	abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has proposed a “NIST Ballistics Identification System (NBIS)” to facilitate accurate ballistics identifications and fast evidence searches [1]. The NBIS will use three-dimensional (3D) topography measurements for ballistics identification and evidence searches. The 3D topographies will be subdivided into arrays of correlation cells in order to help identify “valid correlation areas” and eliminate “invalid correlation areas” from the matching and identification procedure. “Synchronous processing” is proposed for correlating dozens or even hundreds of cell pairs at the same time. Based on the concept of correlation cells, a “Contiguous Matching Cells (CMC)” method using three identification parameters of the paired correlation cells (cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration position in x-y and registration angle θ) is proposed for high accuracy ballistics identifications. Based on the proposed CMC method, a “National Ballistics Evidence Search Engine (NBESE)” is also proposed for fast and accurate ballistics evidence searches.},

	abstract = {The Miami-Dade Police Department Crime Laboratory conducted a research study on the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge casings fired in 10 consecutively manufactured 9mm Ruger slides to improve understanding of the accuracy, reliability, and measurement validity in the firearm and tool mark discipline of forensic science. The foundation of firearm and tool mark identification is that each firearm/tool produces a signature of identification (striation/impression) that is unique to that firearm/tool, and through the examination of the individual striations/impressions, the signature can be positively identified to the firearm/tool that produced it. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report questioned the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions left on fired evidence as well as the validity and error rate in firearms identification. This study analyzed the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge cases fired in 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger slides by analyzing breech face striations/impressions through an evaluation of the participants’ accuracy in making correct identifications. One semi-automatic pistol and nine additional consecutively manufactured slides were utilized. Consecutively manufactured slides are significant to this study because they were manufactured with the same equipment/tools, one right after the other. Even though these slides were consecutively made, their signatures should be different. Test sets included test fired casings from each slide, as well as unknowns. Participants were firearm \& tool mark examiners throughout the United States. One hundred and fifty-eight test sets were distributed to laboratories in forty-six states and the District of Columbia. The test sets were designed to determine an examiner’s ability to correctly identify unknown cartridge casings fired from 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger Slides to test fired cartridge casings fired from the same slides. This empirical study established an error rate of less than 0.1 percent. Durability testing established that the Ruger Slides maintained their individual signature after multiple firings.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

To date, 697 participants have utilized over 240 test sets consisting of bullets fired through 10 consecutively rifled RUGER P-85 pistol barrels. Here, we report on the results of the ongoing “10-barrel test” up until the point in time of writing this manuscript. To analyze the totality of data thus far collected, a Bayesian approach was selected. Posterior average examiner error rates are assigned assuming only vague prior information. Given the data found over the course of this diverse decades-long study, our most conservative value for average examiner error rate has a posterior mean of 0.053\% with a 95\% probability interval of [1.1 × 10−5\%, 0.16\%].},

	abstract = {The comparative readability of 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) bar charts was assessed using the method of constant stimuli, and the corresponding Weber constants and just-noticeable-differences were computed. It was predicted that the just-nociceable-difference for 3D charts would be larger than for 2D charts. 36 bar charts (18 2D and 18 3D) were prepared for individual presentation on an overhead projector. Each chart contained two bars, one of standard size (25 units) and a second that varied in size from 24 to 26 units in increments of 0.25 units (1\% of the standard). 57 undergraduates in psychology were shown the 36 charts in a random sequence for 3 sec. each, separated by 3-sec. intervals. Participants recorded comparative size judgements of bars for each chart. Multivariate analyses identify an advantage in accuracy (in the order of magnitude of approximately 10\%) for 2D rather than 3D bar charts, after controlling for sex, age, and use of corrective lenses. The computed Weber constants for these judgements were similar to those computed for visual intensity over 100 years ago, but—as predicted—the just-noticeable-difference for 3D charts was larger (implying that larger differences are needed on 3D charts to distinguish closely related bars). Furthermore the use of traditional psychophysical approaches (such as the method of constant stimuli) in assessing graphical aids would appear to be justified.},
